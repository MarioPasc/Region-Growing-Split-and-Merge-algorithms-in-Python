Created by Mario Pascual Gonz√°lez, a bioinformatics student, as part of a project for the course "Biomedical 
Images". 

The SplitAndMerge class encapsulates an image segmentation algorithm using a split-and-merge technique 
adapted for biomedical image processing. The algorithm is based on quadtree decomposition, segmenting image regions 
according to specified intensity thresholds.

This class is open-source and may be freely used and modified. Users are encouraged to adapt and improve the 
functions herein to meet their specific requirements or to contribute to its evolution in the spirit of collaborative 
development.

class SplitAndMerge:
    """
    The SplitAndMerge class encapsulates a segmentation algorithm for grayscale images based on quadtree
    decomposition, guided by intensity thresholds and region dimensions. Upon instantiation, the class initializes
    with an image and parameters including minimum and maximum intensity thresholds (min_th and max_th) for region
    segmentation and a minimum dimension (min_dim) for subregions in the quadtree. It ensures that these thresholds
    are within valid ranges and that the min_dim is feasible for splitting.

        dimension size for quadtree regions.

    This is the core functionality of the class is implemented in the split_and_merge method, which orchestrates 
    the segmentation process. It starts by labeling different regions of the image using an initial label count. A 
    private, recursive helper function, recursive_split_and_merge, is defined within this method to handle the 
    splitting of the image into quadrants and their potential merging based on the predicate function's outcome. If a 
    region's intensity characteristics satisfy the predicate, it is marked with a unique label; otherwise, 
    it is split into smaller quadrants. This process continues until the minimum allowable region size (min_dim) is 
    reached. The resulting segmented_image is a labeled matrix where each uniquely identified region is marked with a 
    different integer, representing the segmented portions of the original image according to the specified criteria.
